# Mapping Earthquakes
Use JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

## Module Overview
In this module, you will use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.
